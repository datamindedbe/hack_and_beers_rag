    "You can make the RAG step as simple or as complex as you like - consider some of the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* how best to chunk the data?\n",
    "* what information to pass to the generation step? is any preprocessing/augmentation needed\n",
    "* are there any metrics you can incorporate to your pipeline at runtime? (NOTE: avoid using recall as this can become computationally expensive)\n",
    "* what possible data posioning attacks might be relevent to this exercise? How, can you protect against them?\n",
    "* ... be creative and think of other improvements you may like to implement\n",
